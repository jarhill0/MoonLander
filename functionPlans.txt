GUI - user interface (aka SDL)
ML - the machine learning program
GE - the game

The GUI and the ML are asynchronous. They both contain main methods.

To begin, the GE initializes/resets any relevant fields.

While the game is not over:
  ML/GUI will pass inputs to the GE
  GE calls ->
    GameState step(InputState input); // defined in GE

InputState will be a string that represents all the current inputs being pressed
  Example: Let up = 1, down = 2. Then input could be "", "1", "2" or "12".

At this point, the GUI/ML can begin a new game when ready by calling the initializer.
