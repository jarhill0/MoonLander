GUI - user interface
ML - the machine learning program
GE - the game engine


The GUI/ML programs will have the
int main();
method. 

To begin the game, the GUI/ML programs call
GameState init();
as defined in the GE, which will initialize/reset the game and prepare
it for the step() function to run (to run again, if a game just finished).

Input will be generated by the GUI/ML programs in the main program.
The main program calls
GameState step(InputState input);
which is defined in the GE.

InputState will have:
boolean rightDown;
boolean leftDown;
boolean upDown;
boolean gameOver;
as well as booleans for any other controls.

The GUI/ML programs will keep calling step() until (gameOver == true) .
At this point, the GUI/ML can begin a new game when ready by calling init().
