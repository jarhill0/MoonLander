To whomever is trying to run the GP with valgrind, it will say that there is an unknown instruction and must exit. This is a known bug. It will also say it is leaking about 74k bytes, but thats also because of a well known "feature".

In order to actually run valgrind correctly, modify the function usigned RandGen::genSeed() in gp.cpp and change "return random_device()()" to "return 0".


On GitHub, some commits managed to come from the account "tauqua". That is my (Ben S) personal account, and I have no idea why GitHub Desktop didn't use my @oberlin account, but that's who that is.
